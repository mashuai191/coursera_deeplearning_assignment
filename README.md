# coursera_deeplearning_assignment
This is the assignment from Coursera Deep Learning course for learning purpose. Please don't copy to your excercise. Andrew's this specifization course really helped me a lot on understanding various concept of DL, and give me a great chance to pratice on assignments. Great thanks to Andrew Ng for the best online course i ever take!

If you haven't take Andrew's deep learing course, i stronly recommend you to take those. And then if you like this repo, please add a star to it and i will appreciate that.

## Programming Assignments
- Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- Course 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
- Course 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects
- Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks
- Course 5: Sequence Models

**Status**: course 1/2/3/4 done. 5 RNN not done.

**Note**: To save time, I created a docker image at https://hub.docker.com with name mashuai/machine_learning_default. Everyone can download it to run these assignments in the docker container, with your assignment folder mounted properly by -v option. 
<br/>Example: <code>docker run -it -v /home/mashuai/study/deeplearning/coursera_deeplearning_assignment:/notebooks  -p 80:8888 mashuai/machine_learning_default:xxx</code>
